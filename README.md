## Features
üëâ User Input: Location (uses Google's Places API), Number of days visting, budget, and number of travellers.
üëâ Authentication: Google Authenticates users when generating a trip.
üëâ Trip information: Google Gemini outputs details of the trip in JSON format, and information is accessed to display details.
üëâ Trip details: Users are given recommended hotels, and places to visit as well as the time to visit, and costs if any.

## NOTE
Creating a trip, and viewing a trip is implemented.
Issue ran into is the Google Image URL - we are able to attain the image and view it, however there is axios 400 error.
Would have loved to try debug further, however each refresh I believe was triggering an API call, and google API's are free up to an extent, and I was accruing charges thus I decided not to pursue further.
